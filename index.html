                        come up with some new tricks, and with some luck you might find a way out."</figcaption>

                    Maryam Mirzakhani, (born May 3, 1977, Tehrān, Iran—died July 14, 2017, 
                    Palo Alto, California, U.S.)
                </p>
                <p>
                    Iranian mathematician who became (2014) the first woman and the first Iranian 
                    to be awarded a Fields
                    Medal. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The citation for her award recognized “her outstanding contributions to the dynamics and 
                    geometry of Riemann surfaces and their moduli spaces.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    While a teenager, Mirzakhani won gold medals in the 1994 and 1995 International 
                    Mathematical Olympiads for high-school students, attaining a perfect score in 1995.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In 1999 she received a B.Sc. degree in mathematics from the Sharif University of 
                    Technology in Tehrān.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Five years later she earned a Ph.D. from Harvard University for her dissertation 
                    Simple Geodesics on Hyperbolic Surfaces and Volume of the Moduli Space of Curves.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Mirzakhani served (2004–08) as a Clay Mathematics Institute research fellow and 
                    an assistant professor of mathematics at Princeton University. In 2008 she became 
                    a professor at Stanford University.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Her technique involved considering the moduli spaces of the surfaces. In this case 
                    the modulus space is a collection of all Riemann spaces that have a certain characteristic.
                    Mirzakhani found that a property of the modulus space corresponds to the number of
                    simple closed geodesics of the hyperbolic surface.
